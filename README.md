# NewBeginnings

Hi, I'm Annie, studying the ACS graduate program in [Northwest Missouri State University](https://www.nwmissouri.edu/). 

A few days back, I had the patience to watch a YouTube advertisement on [![charity: water](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UE9UvT5ujyg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE9UvT5ujyg) and it got me thinking why is no one talking about drinking water. Topics like fitness and skincare are dominating the market so it's only appropriate to shed some light on something that makes up 60% of our body.

## Charity: water

[Charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/) is a non-profit organization founded by [Scott_Harrison](https://twitter.com/scottharrison) in 2006. They strive to build wells in rural Africa and Asia; as of now, they have built 38,000 wells that provide clean water to millions of people. Once the wells are established, they are maintained by local staff who are trained by the organization in educating the villagers about hygiene and healthcare.

Typically, women in Africa walk hundreds of miles to get water. The water that they collect is almost always disease-infested swamps or putrid rivers. But now, with a steady source of water, they have more time to spend with their children and encourage their girls to attend schools. In the pretense of research, I had read the story of Helen Apio who had to choose how to utilize that little quantity of dirty water every day. "I feel beautiful for the first time" is what she said when the team had gone to do a routine check. 
Clean water means many things, better hygiene, stronger immunity, sustainable development but this time it meant 'beautiful'.

I highly recommend everyone to read [Helen Apio's story](https://archive.charitywater.org/stories/i-feel-beautiful-for-the-first-time/).
Educate others about the importance of clean water. Don't leave them in dark. Spread awareness.
